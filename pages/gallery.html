	<p class="gallery">Mark Zuckerberg is best known for founding Facebook and his failed attempts to shift society into the Metaverse. As CEO of Facebook, Zuckerberg has made a fortune harvesting users data without their consent and selling it to other companies. Additionally, Facebook's algorithms have been known to misinform and manipulate people to think a certain way singlehandedly paving the way for domestic terrorist attacks on the Capitol. Don't ask him where he was January 6th!</p>
	<div class="bezos"><img src="../images/bezos.jpg" width="55%"></div>
	<p class="gallery">Jeff Bezos is the founder and former CEO and President of Amazon. During his time as CEO and President, he opposed workers unions, failed to provide liveable wages, and managed to not pay taxes. Some Amazon workers have claimed that they were forced to work in 100 degree weather causing some to collapse. While Bezos claimed to not condone these conditions, he did nothing to change it. Hopefully Blue Origin never reaches Mars!</p>

	<p class="gallery">Elon Musk is a nepo baby most known for buying Tesla out from its real founders. The working conditions in Tesla factories have been compared to those of sweatshops with 80+ hour work weeks and little to no injury reports. Meanwhile, Musk finds it appropriate to tweet anti-union sentiments. Society has witnessed Musk fail to operate Twitter as its new CEO. For a man with three different baby mommas he should pick a struggle.</p>
